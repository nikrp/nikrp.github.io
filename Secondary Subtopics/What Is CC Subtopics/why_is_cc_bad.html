        <h3>Drought:</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Drought is caused by climate change. It might be confusing how it works because climate change also causes rising
                sea levels, which is the complete opposite of drought. But it makes sense, and here is the (simple) logic behind it.
                Due to climate change. Our planet's temperature is getting warmer. Because of this, there is an increase in evaporation
                of our water sources and other bodies of water. This logic is very simple, it‚Äôs not that hard to understand if you know
                what words like evaporation means. Climate change is also altering the timing of water availability. This means that
                warmer winter temperatures are causing less precipitation (snow, rain, hail, things like that) to fall.

        <!--Storms-->
        <h3>Storms:</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Water vapor is fuel for storms. When it condenses, it releases heat into the atmosphere, which fuels the storms. The
                more water vapor evaporates into the atmosphere, the more heat is released and the more fuel the storms have. This can
                create stronger wind speeds in tropical storms and overall strong wind speeds and storms. This goes back to something in
                the droughts section. The hotter the planet gets, the more evaporation there is. So that means more
                water vapor is also evaporated.

            <p>
                Due to climate change, we can experience more heatwaves. They usually occur in the summer, but because of climate change,
                the Earth is getting warmer. The average temperatures are increasing, so the summer heatwaves are going to be hot, and
                there could start to be hotter and more frequent heatwaves in the other seasons, even winter maybe! These greenhouse
                gasses are heating this world a little too much‚Ä¶

        <!--Rising Sea Levels-->
        <h3>Rising Sea Levels:</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Mostly all of the effects of climate change are because of the planet getting warmer. Climate change is also known as
                global warming. So that‚Äôs a big clue to why it‚Äôs named that. But climate change can also cause sea levels to rise. There
                are two ways the warming of the Earth causes this. The first one is that the hotter the water is, the more it expands. So
                when the planet gets hotter, the ocean also does, making it expand little by little. The second one is due to the melting
                of land ice. The hotter the planet gets, the more ice on land melts. That water goes into the oceans, making the sea-level
                rise.

        <!--Melting Ice and Warming Oceans-->
        <h3>Melting Ice and Warming Oceans:</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                The oceans are literally saving us from dying. If it wasn‚Äôt for them, we would‚Äôve probably been gone a long time ago. The
                oceans absorb heat from the sun and spread it equally around the planet. That keeps it from freezing in one spot and
                melting in another. The ocean also absorbs carbon dioxide, which is a greenhouse gas. But when the ocean absorbs sunlight,
                it gets hotter and hotter over time, making the water hotter. The hotter the water is, the faster the glaciers on the ocean melt,
                which also causes more water to go into the ocean, making the sea levels rise again. Also, water expands the hotter it is. So when
                the ocean gets hotter, it expands without any ice melting, leading to rising sea levels again.
