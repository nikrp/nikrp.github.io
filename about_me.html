                I started coding when I was 8 or 9. I started with python. It seemed really boring, so I stopped in like a month.
                But when I was 10, I started again. Using a website called Codakid to write Java. It was really easy because the
                instructors told us everything to do. But after a course, I still wouldn't know that much. It was really fun though,
                it made me start coding again for a long time. I started doing python again and I started liking it when I made some
                games with it and played them. I started to do some other courses after the year was up (it was pricey). My dad
                downloaded a python book for me where I started to learn a lot of what I know now. Then I found 
                <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank">Udemy</a>, 
                there happend to be a sale when I found it, so I got it for only $11.00 when it should have been $80.00 or something.
                It might seem like a lot, but they have a lot of sales, so you can just wait for a sale and then get it if you're
                interested in it. I got it during the New Years sale. Since then, I have made so manyprojects in python and I have
                learned a lot of things. I have made games, quizzes, and more. You even learn some HTML & CSS during the 
                <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?src=sac&kw=100+days+of+python" target="_blank">course</a>,
                so that'suseful. I already knew most of it, so it wasn't hard. Even if you don't know any HTML or CSS, the instructor
                will go over it.You can see some of my projects in python in the "Coding World" page, which is found in the pages icon
                in the top left corner of each page in this site.
