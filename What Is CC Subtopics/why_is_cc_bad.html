        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Drought is caused by climate change. It might be confusing how it works because climate change also causes rising
                sea levels, which is the complete opposite of drought. But it makes sense, and here is the (simple) logic behind it.
                Due to climate change. Our planet's temperature is getting warmer. Because of this, there is an increase in evaporation
                of our water sources and other bodies of water. This logic is very simple, it‚Äôs not that hard to understand if you know
                what words like evaporation means. Climate change is also altering the timing of water availability. This means that
                warmer winter temperatures are causing less precipitation (snow, rain, hail, things like that) to fall.

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Water vapor is fuel for storms. When it condenses, it releases heat into the atmosphere, which fuels the storms. The
                more water vapor evaporates into the atmosphere, the more heat is released and the more fuel the storms have. This can
                create stronger wind speeds in tropical storms and overall strong wind speeds and storms. This goes back to something in
                the <a href="#drought">droughts</a> section. The hotter the planet gets, the more evaporation there is. So that means more
                water vapor is also evaporated.

            <p>
                Due to climate change, we can experience more heatwaves. They usually occur in the summer, but because of climate change,
                the Earth is getting warmer. The average temperatures are increasing, so the summer heatwaves are going to be hot, and
                there could start to be hotter and more frequent heatwaves in the other seasons, even winter maybe! These greenhouse
                gasses are heating this world a little too much‚Ä¶
